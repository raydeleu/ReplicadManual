== Process 
The process to draw a shape in Replicad looks like this: 

image::/images/processv2.png[]

Replicad is a library that is based on another library library called opencascade.js (see https://github.com/donalffons/opencascade.js). The functions in this library are explained at https://ocjs.org/. There are Replicad functions that are close to the opencascade kernel but also more user friendly functions that shield the user from the complexity of this library. The normal flow to define a shape is to start with a 2-dimensional sketch of the shape, then use a function like extrude or revolve to define a 3 dimensional shape. This 3 dimensional shape can then be modified, for example by rounding edges. In its simplest form this modification is applied to all edges at once. A more advanced approach is to select individual edges or faces to apply the modification. When the shape is complete it can be transformed, for example by translating, rotating et cetera. Finally a shape can be combined with another shape. Combinations can mean fusing the shapes together, subtracting one shape from the other or finding the intersection between two shapes. 

A beginner can start with the pre-baked shapes to shorten the path to determine a shape. There are 2 dimensional pre-baked shapes like rectangles and circles, and 3 dimensional shapes like spheres or cylinders.

== Visualiser
A model in Replicad is built using a javascript input file (see next Section). This file defines a "main" function that should return the shapes that you want to visualise or export. The easiest way to check that the part is generated correctly and to export the result is to use the *Visualiser* that is offered on the Replicad site https://studio.replicad.xyz/visualiser.

The Visualiser supports exporting to JSON, STL and STEP format.

== File template
The template to create and display a 3D part in Replicad looks like this.  

[source, javascript]
----
// next lines allow intellisense help in VS Code 
/** @typedef { typeof import("replicad") } replicadLib */
/** @type {function(replicadLib, typeof defaultParams): any} */

function main( 
{
    Sketcher,
    sketchRectangle,
    .. functions used in the code below ..
})
{
    // add code to describe the shape
return  shape   |  
return  {shape: [shape], highlight: [foundFeature]}
}
----

Alternatively you can use the arrow notation for the javascript function

[source, javascript]
----
const main = (
  { Sketcher, sketchRectangle, ... },
  {}
) => {
    // add code to describe the shape
return  shape   |  
return  {shape: [shape], highlight: [foundFeature]}
}

== Sketch
To start a sketch, use the `new Sketcher` command 

[source, javascript]
----
let sketch = new Sketcher("XZ",-5)
".sketchCommands"        (see below)
.close()                    // ends the sketch with line to starting point
.done()                     // ends the sketch without closing
.closeWithMirror()          // closes the sketch with mirror on axis from start to end

----
<<<
Use the following ".sketchCommands" to describe the sketch: 


=== Lines

image::/images/lines.png[]

Lines can be sketched using the line functions. Be aware that points are generally defined as a tuple or array, i.e. enclosed in square brackets. This array either contains the absolute distance in the x and y direction from the origin, or the distance and angle in case of polar coordinates. Relative distances to the x- and y-axis are defined as two separate values dx and dy. 

[cols="1,3",stripes=even]
|===
m| .movePointerTo([x,y])          | move pointer without drawing, can only be used at start
m| .lineTo([x,y])                 | line to absolute coordinates
m| .line(dx,dy)                   | line to relative coordinates
m| .vLineTo(y)                    | vertical line to absolute y
m| .vLine(dy)                     | vertical line to relative y
m| .hLineTo(x)                    | horizontal line to absolute x
m| .hLine(dx)                     | horizontal line to relative x
m| .polarLineTo([radius,theta])   | line to absolute polar coordinates
m| .polarLine(distance,angle)     | line to relative polar coordinates
m| .tangentLine(distance)         | tangent extension over distance
|===

=== Arcs and ellipses
image::/images/arcs.png[]

The following commands are available to create circular and elliptical arcs in your sketch. Just as with lines be aware that points are generally defined as a tuple or array, i.e. enclosed in square brackets. Relative distances to the x- and y-axis are defined as two separate values dx and dy. 
The elliptic curves can be defined in more detail with three extra parameters. If the values are omitted the default values are used.

|===

<<< 
== Create a drawing
A drawing can be understood as an adapted version of a sketch. A sketch starts with identifying the sketching plane first and then defining a wire. As the plane is defined up front, the sketch is in fact a 3D shape from its origin. In contrast a drawing is considered a pure 2D shape that can be placed on a plane after its creation. Compared to a sketch a drawing has the following advantages: 

* drawings can be translated, rotated (in 2D space) and scaled;
* drawings can be used in 2D boolean operations;
* drawings can be exported directly in 2D formats;
* drawings can be placed on other shapes, not only planes
