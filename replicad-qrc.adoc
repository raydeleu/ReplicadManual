== Process 
The process to draw a shape in Replicad looks like this: 

image::/images/processv2.png[]

Replicad is a library that is based on another library library called opencascade.js (see https://github.com/donalffons/opencascade.js). The functions in this library are explained at https://ocjs.org/. There are Replicad functions that are close to the opencascade kernel but also more user friendly functions that shield the user from the complexity of this library. The normal flow to define a shape is to start with a 2-dimensional sketch of the shape, then use a function like extrude or revolve to define a 3 dimensional shape. This 3 dimensional shape can then be modified, for example by rounding edges. In its simplest form this modification is applied to all edges at once. A more advanced approach is to select individual edges or faces to apply the modification. When the shape is complete it can be transformed, for example by translating, rotating et cetera. Finally a shape can be combined with another shape. Combinations can mean fusing the shapes together, subtracting one shape from the other or finding the intersection between two shapes. 

A beginner can start with the pre-baked shapes to shorten the path to determine a shape. There are 2 dimensional pre-baked shapes like rectangles and circles, and 3 dimensional shapes like spheres or cylinders. 

A finished shape can be exported to a standardised format like STL or STEP. The easiest way is to do this in the Visualizer https://studio.replicad.xyz/visualiser.

== File template
A model in Replicad is built using a javascript input file. The template for this file looks like this: 

[source, javascript]
----
// next lines allow intellisense help in VS Code 
/** @typedef { typeof import("replicad") } replicadLib */
/** @type {function(replicadLib, typeof defaultParams): any} */

function main( 
{
    Sketcher,
    sketchRectangle,
    .. functions used in the code below ..
})
{
    // add code to describe the shape
return  shape   |  
return  {shape: [shape], highlight: [foundFeature]}
}
----

Alternatively you can use the arrow notation for the javascript function

[source, javascript]
----
const main = (
  { Sketcher, sketchRectangle, ... },
  {}
) => {
    // add code to describe the shape
return  shape   |  
return  {shape: [shape], highlight: [foundFeature]}
}
----


////
add explanation how to display more models in the visualizer and give them different colours
//// 




== Sketch
To start a sketch, use the `new Sketcher` command 

[source, javascript]
----
let sketch = new Sketcher("XZ",-5)
".sketchCommands"        (see below)
.close()                    // ends the sketch with line to starting point
.done()                     // ends the sketch without closing
.closeWithMirror()          // closes the sketch with mirror on axis from start to end

----
<<<
Use the following ".sketchCommands" to describe the sketch: 


=== Lines

image::/images/lines.png[]

Lines can be sketched using the line functions. Be aware that points are generally defined as a tuple or array, i.e. enclosed in square brackets. This array either contains the absolute distance in the x and y direction from the origin, or the distance and angle in case of polar coordinates. Relative distances to the x- and y-axis are defined as two separate values dx and dy. 

[cols="1,3",stripes=even]
|===
m| .movePointerTo([x,y])          | move pointer without drawing, can only be used at start
m| .lineTo([x,y])                 | line to absolute coordinates
m| .line(dx,dy)                   | line to relative coordinates
m| .vLineTo(y)                    | vertical line to absolute y
m| .vLine(dy)                     | vertical line to relative y
m| .hLineTo(x)                    | horizontal line to absolute x
m| .hLine(dx)                     | horizontal line to relative x
m| .polarLineTo([radius,theta])   | line to absolute polar coordinates
m| .polarLine(distance,angle)     | line to relative polar coordinates
m| .tangentLine(distance)         | tangent extension over distance
|===

=== Arcs and ellipses
image::/images/arcs.png[]

The following commands are available to create circular and elliptical arcs in your sketch. Just as with lines be aware that points are generally defined as a tuple or array, i.e. enclosed in square brackets. Relative distances to the x- and y-axis are defined as two separate values dx and dy. 
The elliptic curves can be defined in more detail with three extra parameters. If the values are omitted the default values are used.
