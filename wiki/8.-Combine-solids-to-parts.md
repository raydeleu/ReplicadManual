m| .cut(tool,optimisation?)     | cut the tool-shape from the shape, if needed you can add an optimisation directive to the function call, optimisation? = {optimisation:"none" / "commonFace" / "sameFace"}   
m| .fuse(otherShape,.. )                                            | fuse the othershape with the shape. Other applications call this a "union" between to shapes
m| .intersect(tool)                                                 | find the volume that is common to the two shapes considered in this method, other applications call this function "common"
m| compoundShapes(shapeArray[])                                     | this function is identical to makeCompound 
m| makeCompound(shapeArray[])                                       | allows to combine an array of any type of shape into a single entity that can be displayed.
