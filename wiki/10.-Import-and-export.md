Placeholder for a chapter on importing and exporting data. Most of these features where already discussed in the section on the Workbench, but especially importing and exporting geometric information may need some additional clarification. 

* how to import geometric data, what types of information can be imported, how, what are the options to use the imported shapes for further modification. What are approaches to extract geometric information from other programs if the tools provided by Replicad make modelling tasks difficult. 

* how to export geometric data, what file types are supported, what are possible pipelines to transfer information from Replicad to STEP to STL or OBJ format. Resolution of tesselation, difference between quality of tesselation produced by different softwares.
