Placeholder for a chapter on importing and exporting data. Most of these features where already discussed in the section on the Workbench, but especially importing and exporting geometric information may need some additional clarification. 

* how to import geometric data, what types of information can be imported, how, what are the options to use the imported shapes for further modification. What are approaches to extract geometric information from other programs if the tools provided by Replicad make modelling tasks difficult. 

* how to export geometric data, what file types are supported, what are possible pipelines to transfer information from Replicad to STEP to STL or OBJ format. Resolution of tesselation, difference between quality of tesselation produced by different softwares.  

## 10.1 Importing shapes

### 10.1.1 Importing 2D shapes

Replicad currently offers no option to import 2D sketches. The author of Replicad has implemented a basic functionality in a website called https://blingmything.sgenoud.com/ that is based on Replicad, but this functionality is not available in Replicad. 

One option to import 2D shapes from other softwares is to analyze the files and extract the relevant coordinates. As an example take the shape shown in the image below. This shape consist of two arcs, one with radius 32 mm on the right and one with radius 20 on the left. According to the original drawing this shape is based on, the two arcs are connected with a third arc, but the radius of this arc is not given in the drawing. Using a so-called constraint based drawing tool it turns out that by entering the dimensions and constraints given in the drawing, the shape is fully defined. Without such a tool you would have to resort to some eye-balling and geometric calculations or approximations.  

An example of a constraint based CAD tool is SolveSpace ([[https://solvespace.com](https://solvespace.com/index.pl)). You could create a sketch in this tool and export the 2D view in Scalable Vector Format (SVG). The image below was created in SolveSpace.

Before exporting the shape you have to hide the construction lines (the green lines in the image) and the dimensions. The resulting SVG file then only contains the path of the shape. The SVG file is in fact a text file that can be opened in any text editor. The definition of the contour can be found by looking for the `path` statements. For the shape above the following path can be found in the SVG file: 

```
<path d='
M5.000 37.000
L97.000,37.000
A32.000,32.000 0 0,0 65.000,5.000
A92.667,92.667 0 0,0 13.991,20.303
A20.000,20.000 0 0,0 5.000,37.000 ' class='s1' />
```
For the purpose of clarity I added a new line for each separate statement, in the actual file the statements are all contained in a single line. The elements of the path are identified by single characters, but the drawing actions defined by these characters are very similar to the drawing methods available in Replicad. 

| SVG path command                                   | Replicad command                                      |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
|Mx y                                                |.movePointerTo([x,y]) or draw([x,y])                   |
|Lx,y                                                |.lineTo([x,y])                                         |
|Arx,ry deg-rotation large-arc?,sweep-positive? x,y  |.ellipseTo([x,y],rx,ry,deg rotation, long_way?, counter? | 

Using this translation, the equivalent Replicad code is: 

```
const {draw}  = replicad

function main()
{
let contour = draw([5,37])
.lineTo([97,37])
.ellipseTo([65,5],32,32,0,false,false)
.ellipseTo([13.991,20.303],92.667,92.667,0,false,false)
.ellipseTo([5,37],20,20,0,false,false)
.close()
.sketchOnPlane("XY")

return contour}
```
The resulting shape in Replicad is shown below. Note that it is drawn upside down and not at the origin, but this can easily be corrected with a rotation and a translation.

This approach does not always work, as in some cases the exported SVG will not contain arcs but pieces of straight lines that approximate a curve. This seems the case when the drawing consists of splines or bezier curves instead of circular arcs. In that case converting the SVG is often not practical, as modifications of the resulting shapes with fillets - one of the modifications that cannot be performed in 3D by SolveSpace - often fails on these shapes. 


### 10.1.2 Importing 3D shapes

Replicad offers two basic options to import 3D shapes, namely import of STEP files and import of STL files.
