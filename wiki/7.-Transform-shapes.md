The transform functions require a 2D face or a 3D shape. As explained in Section 3, sketches can not be transformed. If you want to transform a sketch, use the `draw()` function. The generic instruction to transform a face or shape is: 

``` javascript
transformedShape = shape."transformCommand"
```  

The following transformations are offered by Replicad:

| method                                               | description                                        |
| -----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| .translate([dx,dy,dz])                               | Translate a part over distance dx,dy,dz along the respective axis
| .translateX(dx)                                      | Translate a part along the x-axis only
| .translateY(dy)                                      | Translate a part along the y-axis only
| .translateZ(dz)                                      | Translate a part along the z-axis only
| .rotate(angleDeg,axisOrigin[x,y,x],axisEnd[x,y,x])   | Rotate a part over the indicated degrees along an axis defined by two points 
| .scale(number)                                       | Scale the part equally in all directions
| .mirror("YZ",[-10,0])                                | Mirror the part in a given plane
