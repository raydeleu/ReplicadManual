## 4.1 Create wires in 3D 
In comparison to sketches which create wires or faces in 2D, the following functions create a wire in 3D. These wires can be used for example to create a 3-dimensional path for a sweep operation. This operation might be needed to create a tube that is bend in a 3-dimensional shape, such as the frame of a chair.

## 4.2 Create faces in 3D

You can not only create wires in 3D but also complete faces. The difference between a wire and a face is that a face consists of a sketch or 3D wire that encloses a surface. This surface can be flat but also bend in space. 

| method                                | description                  |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `makeFace(wire)`                      | Create a face from a wire consisting only of edges
| `makeNewFaceWithinFace(face,wire)`    | Create a face on another face using a wire   
| `makeNonPlanarFace(wire)`             | Create a curved surface from a non-planar wire
| `makePolygon(points[])`               | Create a face from an array of points in a plane
| `makeOffset(face,offset,tolerance)`   | Create an offset to a face
| `makePlaneFromFace() `                | Extend a face out to an infinite plane parallel to this face
| `makeSolid(faces[]/shell)`            | Create a solid from the volume that is defined by the array of faces or by a surface. 


The following code example demonstrates how faces in 3 dimensions can be created using a quite complicated algorithm. In this example, the faces consisting of triangular surfaces are assembled in such a way that they completely enclose a volume, without leaving a gap. Using the method `makeSolid` the volume enclosed by these faces can then be converted to a solid. In the image below this is demonstrated by cutting a sphere out of the newly created shape. Note that without this final step, the faces represent infinitely thin surfaces floating in space. This might be sufficient to create a 3D shape for visualization, but does not allow 3D printing the object. The next section will explain the concept of shapes (solids) in more detail.
