## 2.1 How to create 3D parts? 

The purpose of using Replicad is creating a 3D representation of a solid part for visualisation or 3D printing. 
The process to create a 3D solid part in Replicad looks like this:

To understand this process, it might help to explain some terminology first. The following image shows some basic concepts that apply to almost all 3D modelling programs:

The 3D space is defined by so-called coordinates. The coordinates are measured along three cartesian axes (see [Wikipedia Cartesian Axes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). You might think of them als length, width and height, but in 3D programs they are mostly called the X,Y and Z-axis where the Z-axis is pointing up. Using the coordinates you can define "points" in space. When these spaces are connected by a line, these lines are called "edges". When the edges completely enclose a flat area, this can be defined as a "face". In some programs such a face is referred to as a "polygon". Extruding an open edge is performed by shifting a copy of the edges. A real life comparison is creating a soap film when lifting the edges from a soap bath. The resulting 3D shape is a "shell", as it only contains walls that are infinitesimally  thin. When the edge is closed, you can consider the shape as a volume that is completely enclosed in faces. When you assume that the enclosed volume is completely filled with material, you have a "solid". 

When you now use this terminology of "points", "edges", "faces", "shells" and "solids" the process of creating 3D shapes can be explained using the following steps: 

**Step 1: Create a 2 dimensional sketch** 

The normal flow to define a solid part is to start with a 2-dimensional sketch of the part. You often start with a sketch that contains most information of the 3D shape. So in case of a car, you would probably start with the side view as this tells you more about the shape than the front view. How to create a sketch in Replicad will be explained in [Chapter 3](./3.-Sketch.md). [Chapter 4](4.-Create-3D-wires-and-faces) discusses a special type of edge, namely a socalled "wire" that can be thought of as an edge that is not necessarily in a flat plane. An example is a helix, a wire in the shape of a rotating staircase or screw. "Wires" can be used as a guide rails to sweep a face to create special 3D shapes. 

**Step 2: Create a solid shape**

By using a method like extruding, lofting, revolving or sweeping, the 2D sketch is translated into a 3-dimensional solid. The methods to add thickness to the 2D sketch are explained in [Chapter 5](./5.-Create-solid-shapes). 

**Use simple predefined drawings or solids**

A beginner can start with pre-baked shapes, i.e. standard shapes, to shorten the path to determine a shape. There are 2 dimensional pre-baked shapes like rectangles, rounded rectangles, circles, ellipes, and 3 dimensional shapes like boxes, spheres or cylinders. The functions to create standard 2D and 3D shapes are detailed in  respectively [Chapter 3](./3.-Sketch.md) and [Chapter 5](./5.-Create-solid-shapes). 

**Modify the solid shape**

The 3 dimensional shape can then be modified, for example by rounding or chamfering the sharp edges. In its simplest form this modification is applied to all edges at once. A more advanced approach is to select individual edges or faces to apply the modification. The modification-methods and functions to select edges are discussed in [Chapter 6](6.-Modify-solids). 

**Move or transform the solid shapes**

After their creation, solid shapes can be moved and rotated. Other transformations are scaling the part or creating a mirrored version. The transformation methods are described in [Chapter 7](7.-Transform-shapes). 

**Combine parts**

Different parts can be combined to create new shapes. Combining parts can mean fusing parts together, subtracting the volume of one part from the other part, intersect parts or combine parts in a group or compound. (see Section 8). 


All the steps described above will explained separately in the next sections. 

## 2.2 Comparing the Replicad approach with other tools 

### 2.2.1 Comparing Replicad to CAD tools

For users that have used a CAD (computer aided design) program earlier, the terminology will sound very familiar. Tools like 

* Siemens SolidEdge (https://solidedge.siemens.com/en/solutions/users/hobbyists-and-makers/), 
* Dassault Solidworks (https://www.solidworks.com/), 
* OnShape (https://onshape.com)
* Autodesk Fusion 360 (https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/personal)
* FreeCad (https://www.freecad.org/) 

use a very similar approach, although they do not use code to determine the shape but visual interaction. The illustration below shows the interface of OnShape. At the left of this interface there is a list of parameters and so-called features. In fact this contains the same information as is represented in the code of Replicad. Starting from the top there are parameters that determine the dimensions of the shape, then a sketch of the sideview, an extrusion, adding fillets (rounding of edges) and then some actions to combine shapes.

### 2.2.2 Other code based tools
Users coming from OpenSCAD (https://www.openscard.org) will immediately recognize the coding approach but might be tempted to start with the prebaked 3D shapes first, as this makes modelling in OpenSCAD so fast. Go to [[Pre-baked shapes]] to see examples how these can be used to quickly model a part by transforming (see [[Transform shapes]] and combining the parts (see [[Combine shapes]]). 

There is no right or wrong way to go about creating the 3 dimensional shape. Compare it to creating a 3 dimensional structure by adding material like a brick layer or painter versus removing material like a sculptor. Use the chapters to quickly find your way through the documentation to suit the approach that you prefer.

> **WARNING**
> The user should be aware that Replicad is built upon the OpenCascade 3D modelling kernel which is available as open source and may be used without paying any license fee. However, this kernel has quite some limitations compared to kernels that are developed by large companies. 

> **Topological naming problem**
> One of the most referenced shortcomings of OpenCascade is referred to as the "Topological Naming Problem" (or TNP). Whenever a model is modified so that the number of faces or edges change, the internal names of faces and edges are changed by the kernel. If your model relies on referencing the edges or faces by their old name, rebuilding the model will fail. Currently the developers of OpenCascade try to correct this issue by using a more complex identification method for faces and edges, but as this affects the complete kernel this change may take a long time. 

> **Rounding/fillets**
> Another shortcoming is related to filleting. This will be discussed in https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/wiki/6.-Modify-solids [*6 Modify solids*].
