## 5.1 What is a shape or solid?

A solid in OpenCascade is a 3D volume that is closed. Closed means that the infinitely thin surfaces that build the shape enclose the volume completely. 

<img src=https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/blob/main/images/thickness.png width="800"> 

The generic command to create a 3D solid shape from a 2D sketch is based on adding thickness. This can be performed using the following basic command, where the method `thicknessMethod` has to be replaced with any of the methods listed in the table below. 

``` javascript
let shape = sketch.thicknessMethod
``` 

## 5.2 Methods to add thickness to a 2D sketch

The `.thicknessMethods` that are available to add thickness or volume to a 2D sketch are listed below. The configurations consists of a number of parameters between curly brackets. In some cases the configuration can contain other configurations. In the next sections the commands will be clarified with code examples, so the table is intended only for quick reference. The parameters with a questionmark have a default value and can be omitted when the default is applicable. 

| method                                     | description                                                                                                |
| -----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.extrude(distance,{extrusionConfig?}) `               | extrude a face over a distance normal to the face.                                                         |
| `{extrusionConfig}`                                    | `origin:[xyz], extrusionDirection[xyz],twistAngle:deg,{extrusionProfile}`                                  |
| `{extrusionProfile}`                                   | {profile:"linear" / "s-curve", endFactor: scale}                                         |
| `.loftWith([otherSketches],{loftConfig},returnShell?)` | build a solid through lofting between different wires                                    |
| `{loftConfig}`                                         |{ruled: boolean, endPoint:[point],startPoint:[point]}                                     |                   
| `.revolve(revolutionAxis:[point]?,revolveConfig?)`     | revolve a drawing around the z-axis (or indicated axis) to create a solid shape.         |                    
| `{revolveConfig}`                                      | `{origin: [xyz]}`  origin on which axis of revolution is centered                        |   
| `revolution(face,[origin],[direction],degrees)`        | revolve a face around the axis identified in the function, over the angle indicated in degrees    | 
| `.face()`                                              | This is not really a thickness method  but a method to create the first surface from a sketch or drawing. Note that this method is not needed in most cases as a closed sketch already is translated into a face that can be used directly for extrusion, revolving or sweeping. 
| `.sweepSketch( (plane, origin) => sketchFunction(plane,origin) )` |  Sweep the sketch defined by the sketchFunction along the sketch used as the object for this method.
| `makeSolid(faces[]/shell)`                             | Create a solid from the volume that is defined by the array of faces or by a surface. 



### 5.2.1 .extrude()

Extruding adds thickness to a drawing in the direction normal to the drawing, thereby creating a solid. You can think of it like pushing dough through a hole that has the shape of the drawing. In the simplest form you only have to specify the height of the extrusion. As shown in the image below you can adapt some characteristics of the extrusion. 

<img src=https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/assets/38007983/fa12f0de-991d-4208-ac82-b2e6b20ca13d> 

The following code explains some of the modifications that you can apply to the extrusion. The first parameter, the extrusion height determines the distance over which the extrusion is performed. In a normal situation this is also the height of the resulting object, but if the extrusion axis is tilted and not performed from the center of the object (i.e. the origin of the extrusion is different from the origin of the object) the height can be different from the extrusion distance. The `twistAngle`, in degrees, determines how many degrees the extrusion is twisted during the extrusion. Finally, the `extrusionProfile` allows to change the scale of the drawing during the extrusion and to change the profile followed between the profile at the start and the profile at the end of the extrusion. The "s-curve" profile creates a profile that starts and ends in the direction of the extrusion but adapts to the change in width of the extrusion as defined by the "endFactor".


``` javascript
// create a drawing that you want to extrude
let rectangleDrawing = drawRoundedRectangle(50,30,3)
.translate([-40,40]).sketchOnPlane("XY")

let extrudeDraft = rectangleDrawing.clone()
.extrude(30,                                                // height of the extrusion
{origin: [-40,40,0],                                        // if the drawing was translated you have to adjust the origin as well            
extrusionDirection: [0,0,1],                               // direction of the extrusion in relation to the origin
twistAngle:90,                                             // the twist applied during the extrusion 
extrusionProfile: { profile: "s-curve", endFactor: 0.5 }}) // the profile of the extrusion
```

It is important to note that many of the modifications relate to the origin, so often it is easier to create your model at the origin and translate it after building the solid than to move the drawing and apply the extrusion later. 

To create a solid using extrusion, the sketch or drawing that you use as a base for extruding should be closed. It is possible to extrude an open wire, but this results in a shell instead of a solid. 

### 5.2.2 .revolve()

The method `.revolve()` creates a shape based on revolving the drawing around the z-axis. The drawing that is revolved should be closed, so the edges should completely enclose an area and form a face. Revolving an open (i.e. non-closed) drawing will result in the creation of a shell instead of a solid. The difference is shown in the image below. 

<img src=https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/assets/38007983/d9610383-9d06-4c85-9568-2dacb504db03 width="600">

If you want to use another axis for the revolution, you can add a point that indicates the direction from the origin. If you want to use another origin for the axis of revolution this can be added in a configuration between curly brackets. In the example below the rotation is performed around the x-axis with the origin displaced to z = -10.  

``` javascript
let profileClosed = draw()
.line(20,0).line(5,5).line(0,30).line(-25,0)
.close().sketchOnPlane("XZ")
.revolve([1,0,0],{origin:[0,0,-10]})
.translate(-30,-30)
----

The `.revolve()` method always revolves a shape over 360 degrees. If you dig into the documentation you will find a function called `revolution` that allows to create a body of revolution where the angle can be defined. The function requires a face as input, so you need to add the `face()` method after a drawing to create a face first. The code then look like this: 

[source, javascript]
----
let {draw} = replicad
function main(){
// let solid = revolution(face,[x,y,z origin],[x,y,z direction], degrees)
let profile = draw().hLine(10).line(3,5).hLine(-13).close().sketchOnPlane("XZ")
let halfCircle =  revolution(profile.face(),[0,0,0],[0,0,1],180)
return halfCircle}
```

### 5.2.3 .loftWith()

The method `.loftWith(sketch/placed drawing)` builds a loft along the sketches fed to the method.

To create a loft you need two or more (placed) drawings. In the following example three profiles are drawn and placed on different planes. Then one of the profiles is used as the parent to which the `loftWith()` method is applied. The method can accept multiple profiles ordered in an array. The order of the drawings in the array determines the way the loft is built. 

<img src=https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/assets/38007983/d5da73ae-3c28-40e2-a3fc-752e4122f5d7>

In the example, the drawings used for the loft are clones (using the `.clone()` method) to be able to re-use or display the drawings. The loft method normally deletes the drawings after creating the loft to save memory. 

``` javascript
const {draw} = replicad

function main(){
let scale = 1/10
let baseLength = 200*scale;
let topLength = Math.sqrt((2*Math.pow((baseLength/2),2)))
let height = (1368-196.85)*scale

let baseProfile = draw()
.hLine(baseLength).vLine(baseLength).hLine(-baseLength).close()
baseProfile = baseProfile.translate([-baseLength/2,-baseLength/2]).sketchOnPlane("XY")

let midProfile = draw().hLine(baseLength/2).polarLine(topLength/2,45).vLine(baseLength/2)
.polarLine(topLength/2,135).hLine(-baseLength/2).polarLine(topLength/2,225)
.vLine(-baseLength/2).close()
midProfile = midProfile.translate([-baseLength/4,-baseLength/2]).sketchOnPlane("XY",height/2) 

let topProfile = draw().polarLine(topLength,45).polarLine(topLength,135)
.polarLine(topLength,225).close()
topProfile = topProfile.translate([0,-baseLength/2]).sketchOnPlane("XY", height)

let tower = baseProfile.clone().loftWith([midProfile.clone(),topProfile.clone()],{ruled:true})
let tower1 = baseProfile.clone().loftWith([midProfile.clone(),topProfile.clone()],{ruled:false})
.translate(30,0,0)
let tower2 = baseProfile.clone().loftWith(topProfile.clone(),{ruled:true}).translate(60,0,0)

return [{shape: baseProfile, color:"orange"},{shape:midProfile, color: "orange"}
,{shape:topProfile, color:"orange"},{shape: tower, opacity:"0.5"}
,{shape: tower1},{shape: tower2}]} 
``` 

It is also possible to use a sketch as a profile for the loft. The code below shows an extract from the definition of a watering can that is based on the `loftWith` method. Three circles are used to define the shape. In this case the circles are created using a `sketch` object. Note that you need to extract the face before creating the loft, using the `face()` method. Using a drawing instead of a sketch therefore is a bit more intuitive. As we will see below, you cannot use a face extracted from an object to create the loft, which seems contradictionary with the need to create a face from a sketch. 
 
``` javascript
// create cross sections of the filler for the carafe
//          used a workaround to rotate and translate the sketch to the required position
let fillHole = sketchCircle(12).face().rotate(-20,[0,0,0],[0,1,0]).translate([-35,0,135])
fillHole = sketchFaceOffset(fillHole,0);
let topBody = sketchCircle(8).face().translate([0,0,100]);   // radius 8 at 100 mm 
topBody = sketchFaceOffset(topBody,0); 
let fillBottom = sketchCircle(9).face().rotate(20,[0,0,0],[0,1,0]).translate([0,0,80]); 
fillBottom = sketchFaceOffset(fillBottom,0); 

// filler shape is created as a loft between the three wires
let filler    = fillHole.loftWith([topBody,fillBottom],{ruled: false});
```

The configuration `{ruled: false}` produces a smooth line between the profiles, whereas the configuration `{ruled: true}` creates straight lines between the profiles.

The following source sample shows how to extract a face from an existing object and use this as part of a loft. Here a new sketch is created from the edges extracted from the face of the object. This is necessary as a face on an object can also contain holes, whereas the wire to create the loft should be closed and not contain a hole. 

<img src=https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/assets/38007983/fb7eab29-7829-41bd-9f89-6f8f0f7a12cd>


``` javascript
const r = replicad

export default function main(p) {
  const box = r.makeBaseBox(30, 10, 20).translateY(-5)

  const triBase = new r.FaceFinder().inPlane("XZ", 0).find(box, { unique: true })
  const triMid = r.drawCircle(10).translate(0, 10). // lay onto XY plane
    sketchOnPlane("XZ", -20)
  const triTop= r.drawCircle(10).translate(0, 10). // lay onto XY plane
    sketchOnPlane("XZ", -50)

  // I should expose this as a helper `sketchFace` function
  const faceSketch = new r.Sketch(triBase.clone().outerWire(), { 
    defaultDirection: triBase.normalAt(triBase.center), 
    defaultOrigin: triBase.center 
  })

  const tri = triTop.clone().loftWith([triMid,faceSketch],{ruled: true})

  return [
    { shape: box, name: "sleeve", color: "green", highlightFace: (f) => f.inPlane("XZ", 10) },
    { shape: tri, name: "tri", color: "blue" },
    { shape: triBase, name: "triBase", color: "red" },]}
```

If you want to start or end the loft with a single point, you can use the configuration setting `startPoint` or `endPoint`. The sample below demonstrates how to use this configuration. 

``` javascript
const { drawRoundedRectangle, drawCircle } = replicad;
const main = () => {
  const rect = drawRoundedRectangle(5, 10).sketchOnPlane();
  const circle = drawCircle(3).sketchOnPlane("XY", 10);

  return rect.loftWith(circle, { endPoint: [2, 2, 15] });
};
```

### 5.2.3 .sweepSketch()

The method `.sweepSketch` can be used to create a solid by sweeping a sketch along another curve. An example is the chair profile shown in the icon at the beginning of this chapter or the ringshape shown in the image below:  

<img src=https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/blob/main/images/sweepSketch-samples.png>

The source to create these shapes is: 

``` javascript
const {Sketcher, sketchRectangle, sketchRoundedRectangle,draw}=replicad

const main = () => {
  let p0 = [0, 0];
  let p1 = [50, 100];
  let p2 = [60, -110];
  let p3 = [70, 50];
  let p4 = [100, 25];
  let points = [p1, p2, p3, p4];

// create wavy path on XZ plane
let basePath = new Sketcher("XZ")
    .movePointerTo(p0)
    .bezierCurveTo(p4, points)
    .done()

// sweep a rectangle along the wavy path
let baseShape = basePath.clone().sweepSketch((plane, origin) => 
                sketchRectangle(2, 30, { plane, origin }))
                .translate(0,-40);

// create a path consisting of rounded rectangle
let topPath = sketchRoundedRectangle(110,30,5,{plane:"XY",origin:[50,0,26]})

// create an L-shaped cross section
function ringSection(plane,origin) 
{let section = new Sketcher(plane,origin)
    .hLine(10).vLine(-3).hLine(-8)
    .vLine(-26).hLine(-2).close()
  return section}  

let ringSectionDraw=draw()
.hLine(10).vLine(-3).hLine(-8)
.vLine(-26).hLine(-2).close().sketchOnPlane("YZ")

// sweep the L-shaped section along the rounded rectangle
let topSweep   = topPath.sweepSketch((plane, origin) => ringSection(plane,origin))
.translate(0,60)

return [topSweep, baseShape, ringSectionDraw]}
``` 

As shown in the code above, the `sketchFunction` used in the `.sweepSketch()` can be derived from either a standard sketching function, such as `sketchRectangle(2, 30, { plane, origin })` or by defining your own closed sketch using a `Sketcher` object. This object should then refer to a `(plane, origin)` like this: 

``` javascript
            function sketchFunction(plane,origin) 
            {let section = new Sketcher(plane,origin)
                    (add sketch commands)
                    .close()
            return section}
``` 

A swept object can also be used to cut a profile in another shape. The image below shows an example where the contour of a knop is rounded with a large radius. This is achieved by creating a profile with the appropriate radius that encloses the area that should be "shaved" off. 

<img src=https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/blob/main/images/sweep-knob.png>

The cross section is shown in red, projected on the XY plane. The object resulting from the `.sweepSketch()` method is displayed with a transparent material on top of the knob. 


``` javascript
// identical to side view but only top edge
// to be used as a rail to sweep the 32mm radius profile  
let sweepRail = draw()
.movePointerTo([-60,0])
.ellipse(20*Math.sin(Math.PI/6),20*Math.cos(Math.PI/6),20,20,0,0,false)
.smoothSplineTo([0,32])
.ellipse(32,-32,32,32,Math.PI/2,0,false)
.done()
.sketchOnPlane("YZ")

// create a rounded profile to shape finger of knob  
function sweepProfile(plane,origin)
{let section = new Sketcher(plane,origin)
.movePointerTo([segmentHeight,-20])
.lineTo([segmentHeight,-16])
.threePointsArcTo([segmentHeight,16],[0,0])
.lineTo([segmentHeight,20])
.lineTo([-1,20])
.lineTo([-1,-20])
.close()
return section}

let profileCut = sweepRail.clone()
.sweepSketch((plane,origin) => sweepProfile(plane,origin))
```

The so-called boolean function to cut the material will be discussed in the Chapter [[Combine solids to parts]]. 

### 5.2.6  makeSolid()

The `makeSolid` function can be used to create a solid from a number of faces. The faces need to enclose a volume without any gap. The following code example shows how to create a so-called antiprism. The model represents the One World Trade Center. The following image shows the same shape but for clarity the height is reduced: 

<img src=https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/blob/main/images/anti-prism-short.png>

The shape is created by first creating the triangles that make up the sides of the shape, using the `makePolygon()` method discussed in the previous chapter. The solid is then built by joining these triangles together with the square bottom and top faces. 

``` javascript
const {draw, drawRectangle, makePolygon, makeSolid} = replicad;

function main()
{
let bL = 200/10;  // base length is 200 ft
let h = 1368/10;  // height 1368 ft
let m = (60/0.3048)/10; // first 60 meters are straight, converted to feet

    function antiPrism(bLength,prismHeight,endScale)
    {
        let bL = bLength/2;
        let tL = bL/Math.sin(Math.PI/4)
        let base=[]
        base[1] = [-bL,-bL,0];
        base[2] = [bL,-bL,0];
        base[3] = [bL,bL,0];
        base[4] = [-bL,bL,0];
        base[5] = base[1]   // trick to avoid need for modulus 4

        let top=[]
        top[1] = [0  ,-tL*endScale ,prismHeight]
        top[2] = [tL*endScale  , 0  ,prismHeight]
        top[3] = [0 ,tL*endScale  ,prismHeight]
        top[4] = [-tL*endScale ,0   ,prismHeight]
        top[5] = top[1]    // trick to avoid need for modulus 4

        let face=[]
        face[1] = makePolygon([base[1],base[4],base[3],base[2]]);        
        // not defined counterclockwise to have face facing in negative z-direction
        for (let i=2 ; i<=8; i+=2)
            {
            face[i]     = makePolygon([top[i/2],base[i/2],base[i/2+1]]);
            face[i+1]   = makePolygon([base[i/2+1],top[i/2+1],top[i/2]]);
            }
        face[10] = makePolygon([top[1],top[2],top[3],top[4]]);
        return face;
        }
let faces = antiPrism(bL,h,Math.sin(Math.PI/4));
let tower = makeSolid(faces).translate(0,0,m);
let towerbase = drawRectangle(bL,bL).sketchOnPlane("XY").extrude(m)
tower = tower.fuse(towerbase)
return tower}
``` 

## 5.3 Pre-baked shapes

The methods specified above can be used to create complex shapes but also to create standard shapes like boxes, cylinders or spheres. As these shapes are often used as basic building blocks, Replicad provides a number of functions to automate the creation of the standard shapes. These functions are explained in the following table: 

| method                                                       | description                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| makeCylinder(radius,height,[location],[direction])           |create a cylinder                                   |
| makeBaseBox(xLength,yLength,zLength)                         |create a box                                        |
| makeSphere(radius)                                           |create a sphere                                     |
| makeVertex([point])                                          |create a vertex/point                               |

The shapes listed above are the same shapes that are available in most CAD programs and OpenSCAD. The CAD program for beginner, offered by the company Autodesk at https://tinkercad.com) offers even more basic solids. Apart from the box, cylinder and sphere there are shapes like half domes, piramids, extruded hexagons, donuts et cetera. 


![tinkercad shapes](https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/assets/38007983/de372431-6a53-4bf8-aae4-ade75a9907b9)

Most of these shapes can be created easily with the methods described in this chapter. The following image shows the shapes as created with functions that were described in this and the previous chapters. The only difference is the rounded cube. How all sides of the cube can be rounded will be discussed in Chapter 6. 
(The code to create these shapes can be found in the Appendix with examples). 

![image](https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/assets/38007983/93d3a22c-7108-4fff-85a8-f89382a2c9a0)

If you want to use these shapes as quick building blocks, automating the creation of these shapes using functions will allow you to re-use these components. This will be discussed in Chapter [[9. Automate modelling with functions]]. 





<img src=https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/blob/main/images/mm2023-parts.png>

As shown in <<img-mm2023-parts>> it is possible to create quite complicated parts by just combining simple shapes such as boxes, spheres and cylinders. The shape used in this image is an exercise called Model Mania organized by the company that created the Solidworks CAD program. There are only some fillets missing which were obviously too complicated for the OpenCascade modelling kernel. The shapes are combined using the boolean operations decribed in <<Combine shapes>>. Some of the edges of the basic shapes were rounded. How this can be achieved is explained in <<Modify shapes>>. The result is shown in the image below.
