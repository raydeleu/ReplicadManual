=== 5.1 What is a shape or solid

A solid in OpenCascade is a 3D volume that is closed. Closed means that the infinitely thin surfaces that build the shape enclose the volume completely.

The generic command to create a 3D solid shape from a 2D sketch is based on adding thickness. This can be performed using the following basic command, where the method `thicknessMethod` has to be replaced with any of the methods listed in the table below.

let shape = sketch.thicknessMethod

=== 5.2 Methods to add thickness to a 2D sketch

The following `.thicknessMethods` are available to add thickness or volume to a 2D sketch: 


| method                           | description                                        |
| ---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
m| .extrude(distance,extrusionConfig?)  | extrude a face over a distance normal to the face. In the extrusion configuration it is possible to define a different extrusion direction, a certain profile for the extrusion and a twist over the extrusion. 
m|             {extrusionDirection:[point], ExtrusionProfile:ExtrusionProfile,  origin:[point], twistAngle:deg} | extrusionConfig
m|             {profile:"linear" / "s-curve", endFactor: scale}  | extrusionProfile       
m| .loftWith([otherSketches],loftConfig,returnShell?) | build a solid through lofting between different wires
m|               {   endPoint:[point],
                                        ruled: boolean,
                                    startPoint:[point]} | loftconfig

m| .revolve(revolutionAxis:[point],config?)    | revolve a face around the z-axis to create a solid shape. Adapt the axis of rotation and the origin in the configuration. 
m|             origin:[point]                   |config                            
m| .sweepSketch( (plane, origin) => sketchFunction(plane,origin) ); |  Sweep the sketch defined by the sketchFunction along the sketch used as the object for this method.
m| .face()                              | This is not really a thickness method  but a method to create the first surface from a sketch or drawing. Note that this method is not needed in most cases as a closed sketch already is translated into a face that can be used directly for extrusion, revolving or sweeping. 
m| makeSolid(faces[]/shell)                                     | Create a solid from the volume that is defined by the array of faces or by a surface.

==== 5.2.1 .extrude()




==== 5.2.2 .revolve()



==== 5.2.3 .loftWith()

==== 5.2.3 .sweepSketch()

The `sketchFunction` used in the `.sweepSketch()` can be derived from either a standard sketching function, such as `sketchRectangle(2, 30, { plane, origin })` or by defining your own closed sketch using a `Sketcher` object. This object should then refer to a `(plane, origin)` like this: 


[source,javascript]
----
            function sketchFunction(plane,origin) 
            {let section = new Sketcher(plane,origin)
                    (add sketch commands)
                    .close()
            return section}
---- 


==== 5.2.6  makeSolid()

The `makeSolid` function can be used to create a solid from a number of faces. The faces need to enclose a volume without any gap. The following code example shows how to create a so-called antiprism. The model represents the One World Trade Center.  

``` javascript
const {draw, drawRectangle, makePolygon, makeSolid} = replicad;

function main()
{
let bL = 200/10;  // base length is 200 ft
let h = 1368/10;  // height 1368 ft
let m = (60/0.3048)/10; // first 60 meters are straight, converted to feet

    function antiPrism(bLength,prismHeight,endScale)
    {
        let bL = bLength/2;
        let tL = bL/Math.sin(Math.PI/4)
        let base=[]
        base[1] = [-bL,-bL,0];
        base[2] = [bL,-bL,0];
        base[3] = [bL,bL,0];
        base[4] = [-bL,bL,0];
        base[5] = base[1]   // trick to avoid need for modulus 4

        let top=[]
        top[1] = [0  ,-tL*endScale ,prismHeight]
        top[2] = [tL*endScale  , 0  ,prismHeight]
        top[3] = [0 ,tL*endScale  ,prismHeight]
        top[4] = [-tL*endScale ,0   ,prismHeight]
        top[5] = top[1]    // trick to avoid need for modulus 4

        let face=[]
        face[1] = makePolygon([base[1],base[4],base[3],base[2]]);        
        // not defined counterclockwise to have face facing in negative z-direction
        for (let i=2 ; i<=8; i+=2)
            {
            face[i]     = makePolygon([top[i/2],base[i/2],base[i/2+1]]);
            face[i+1]   = makePolygon([base[i/2+1],top[i/2+1],top[i/2]]);
            }
        face[10] = makePolygon([top[1],top[2],top[3],top[4]]);
        return face;
        }
let faces = antiPrism(bL,h,Math.sin(Math.PI/4));
let tower = makeSolid(faces).translate(0,0,m);
let towerbase = drawRectangle(bL,bL).sketchOnPlane("XY").extrude(m)
tower = tower.fuse(towerbase)
return tower}
```

._Combining shapes to create more complex shapes_ 
[#img-mm2023-parts]
image::https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/blob/main/images/mm2023-parts.png[]

As shown in <<img-mm2023-parts>> it is possible to create quite complicated parts by just combining simple shapes such as boxes, spheres and cylinders. The shape used in this image is an exercise called Model Mania organized by the company that created the Solidworks CAD program. There are only some fillets missing which were obviously too complicated for the OpenCascade modelling kernel. The shapes are combined using the boolean operations decribed in <<Combine shapes>>. Some of the edges of the basic shapes were rounded. How this can be achieved is explained in <<Modify shapes>>. The result is shown in the image below.
