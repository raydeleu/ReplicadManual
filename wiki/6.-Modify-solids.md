## 6.1 What are modifications? 

This section explains how to modify a 3D solid that was created using the functions and methods decribed in the previous chapter. Modifications as described in this section only relate to a single shape. Combining multiple shapes, through fusing, subtracting or intersecting, will be described in the next chapter. 

The following table lists modifications that can be applied to a solid. 

| method                           | description                                        |
| ---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|` .fillet(radiusConfig,filter?) `                                   | round an edge of a shape with a fixed radius or a radius that is defined by a function. The filter refers to the selection mechanism defined in the next secion. It has the general shape of (e) => e.inDirection("X")  
|` .chamfer(radiusConfig,filter?) `                                  | take of a sharp edge by creating a transitional face, default at 45 degrees to a edge
|` .shell(thickness, (f) => f.inPlane("YZ",-20),{tolerance:number})` | create a thin walled object from a shape, removing the indicated face from the shape to provide access to the hollow inside. 
|` makeOffset(shape,thickness)`                                      | create a shape that is offset from the original shape by the thickness. A positive number results in an increased size of the shape, a negative value will result in a smaller shape
|` .addHolesInFace(face,holeWires[])`                                 | create a hole in a shape using the wires that are indicated in the parameters to this function. 
 

Most of the methods listed in the table require the selection of an edge or face of the shape. Therefore the next subsection will explain how edges and faces can be selected. 

## 6.2 Selecting faces or edges for modification
Some of the methods listed in the previous subsection can be used without indicating a specific face or edge.For example, if a fillet is applied to a shape, the same radius of rounding is applied to all sharp edges in the shape. However, in most cases the fillet should be applied only to specific edges. In most visual CAD programs, the edges for the fillet operation are selected with the mouse cursor in the 3D view. In Replicad a filter mechanism has to be used to find the edges. The next paragraphs explain how faces or edges can be selected. Faces are relevant to create a thin walled object (shell) or to create holes in a face. Finding edges is relevant to create rounded edges (fillets) or chamfers.  

### 6.2.1 Selecting faces

Faces can be selected using a `FaceFinder` object or using the so-called arrow notation of javascript. The arrow notation is a shorthand notation to define a function that changes the value of a given parameter. The following code explains this in more detail:  


``` javascript
// create a variable as a new object to which a selection-method is applied
let foundFaces = new FaceFinder().inPlane("XZ",35)
// use this variable as an input to create a shell 
let hollowShape = solidShape.shell(thickness, (f)=>foundFaces,{tolerance:number})

// use the arrow notation to select a face directly as parameter to a method to change a shape 
let hollowShape = solidShape.shell(thickness, (f) => f.inPlane("YZ",-20),{tolerance:number})
 ```

The following methods to select faces are available: 

| method                           | description                                        |
| ---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|` .inPlane("XZ",35)`                                           | select all faces that are positioned in a given plane and offset
|` .parallelTo(plane/face/standardplane)`                                        | select a face parallel to a given plane or face
|` .ofSurfaceType("CYLINDRE")`                                                   | select all faces of a certain type
|` "PLANE" / "CYLINDRE" / "CONE" /"SPHERE"/ "TORUS" / "BEZIER_SURFACE"       /"BSPLINE_SURFACE"/"REVOLUTION_SURFACE"/"EXTRUSION_SURFACE"/ "OFFSET_SURFACE"/"OTHER_SURFACE" `                                               | surface types to use with surfaceType selector 
|` .containsPoint([0,-15,80])`                                                   | select a face that contains a given point
|` .atAngleWith(direction,angle)`                                                | select a face at a certain angle to an axis or plane atAngleWith("Z",20)
|` .atDistance(distance,point)  `                                                | select a face at a given distance to a point 
|` .inBox(corner1,corner2)       `                                               | select a face that is partially located inside the given box
|` .inList(elementList[])    `                                                   | select a face that is in the elementList
|` find(shape,options), options {unique: true}`                                  | returns all the elements that fit the filters
 





### 6.2.2 Selecting edges
Selecting edges works similar to selecting faces.

``` javascript
// create a variable as a new object to which a selection-method is applied
let foundEdges = new EdgeFinder().inPlane("XZ",35)
// use this variable as an input to create a shell 
let roundedShape = solidShape.fillet(radius, (e)=>foundEdges,{tolerance:number})

// use the arrow notation to select an edge directly as parameter to a method to change a shape 
let roundedShape = solidShape.fillet(thickness, (e) => e.inPlane("YZ",-20),{tolerance:number})
 ```

The following selection mechanisms can be used to find and select edges: 

| method                           | description                                        |
| ---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|` .inDirection([x,y,z]/"X"/"Y"/"Z")`                     | find all edges that have the direction
|` .atAngleWith(direction,angle)`                        | atAngleWith("Z",20)
|` .ofLength(number)`                                    | find all edges with a particular length
|` .containsPoint([0,-15,80])`                           | find edges that go exactly through a point
|` .atDistance(distance,point)`                          | same as .containsPoint but allows some margin around the defined point 
|` .inBox(corner1,corner2)`                              | finds all edges that are (partly) within a box
|` .inList(elementList[])`                               | see issue https://github.com/sgenoud/replicad/issues/13, does not work yet
|` .inPlane(inputPlane,origin)`                          | inPlane("XY",30), find all edges that are exactly in the defined plane
|` .ofCurveType(       )`                                | find all edges of a certain curve type. "LINE", "BSPLINE_CURVE", "CIRCLE"
|` .parallelTo(plane / StandardPlane e.g. "XY")`         | find all edges parallel to a stanadard plane
|` .shouldKeep todo?`                                    | tbd
 

>[!NOTE]
>When you reference faces or edges with their index, using the `.inList` method, you may experience the issue of the Topological Naming Problem. If the change to the design parameters results in a changing number of edges or faces, the fillet will no longer be applied to the correct edges. So use this method with care, if you only allow minor changes to the design such as using a different tolerance between two parts. Note that this selector currently does not work as expected, see issue https://github.com/sgenoud/replicad/issues/13. 



### 6.2.3 Combine filters 

| method                           | description                                        |
| ---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|`and`                             | both filters should be applied
|`either`                          | only one of the filters may be applied
|`not`                             | select all other edges than those selected by this filter


 ``` javascript       
            const houseSides = new FaceFinder().either([
            (f) => f.inPlane("YZ", 50),
            (f) => f.inPlane("YZ", -50),]);
     
             const frontWindow = new EdgeFinder()
            .ofCurveType("CIRCLE")
            .not((f) => f.inPlane("XZ"));  
 ```

Below is an example how finders can be combined in the definition of a fillet. 

 ``` javascript       
let axleShape2 = axleHole2.fuse(keySlot2).sketchOnPlane("XZ",20)
let axle2 = axleShape2.extrude(25)
            .fillet(2,(e)=>e.either([
                          (e)=>e.inPlane("XZ",45),
                          (e)=>e.inPlane("XZ",20)]) )
return [axle2];
 ```

## 6.3 .fillet() 

A fillet is a rounded edge. In real products a fillet is often used to remove sharp edges that can be damaged easily and can also cause damage to people and other parts. A rounded corner is easier to coat and paint and after its application the risk of paint peeling of the corner is smaller. A fillet therefore improves the longevity of the product. The rounding on internal edges also helps to reduce stress concentrations. And finally a rounding can help to mate parts, although a chamfer (see next section) is often preferred in that case. 

The fillet method in Replicad has the following form: 

``` javascript
 let roundedBox = box.fillet(radius,(e)=>e.edgeSelectingMethod) 
```
The `edgeSelectionMethod` can be a combination of one or more selection methods as described in the previous section. If the edge selection is omitted, Replicad will try to round all edges of the object. When you select an edge, Replicad uses the "tangent chain" approach to continue the rounding until it encounters a sharp corner. This is illustrated in the image below. Only the edges in the "X" direction are selected for filleting, yet all edges that have a tangent connection to these edges are also rounded. 

<img width="893" alt="image" src="https://github.com/raydeleu/ReplicadManual/assets/38007983/f032cab0-a956-42f1-88eb-0a23aec874df">

In most cases the continuation of the fillet along smoothly connected faces is the intended behaviour. If this is not the case, the order of applying the fillets should be changed. Replicad does offer the capability to suppress the tangential chaining. 

When we take the code of the example and uncomment the additional fillet construction, fillets with three different radii will be applied to the solid. When the order of the two last instruction is changed, the fillet fails with a "kernel error". 

``` javascript
// Demonstration of tangent chain 
const {draw} = replicad

function main(){

let uShape = draw().line(40,0).customCorner(4).line(0,20)
.customCorner(2).line(-8,0).customCorner(2)
.line(0,-12).customCorner(2)
.line(-24,0).line(0,12).line(-8,0).close()
.sketchOnPlane("XY").extrude(20)

uShape = uShape.fillet(2,(e)=>e.inDirection("X"))
//uShape = uShape.fillet(1,(e)=>e.inDirection("Y"))
//uShape = uShape.fillet(3,(e)=>e.inDirection("Z"))

return uShape}
```

Replicad currently only offers circular filets with a constant radius for each assigned edge. On internal edges the fillet is concave (hollow), providing a fluid transition between the adjacent faces. 

If you want to create a full round top on a part you should be aware that joining two fillets will mostly fail. A solution is to approximate the full rounding with a minimal straight part between the two fillets, for example by reducing the size of the fillet with a tolerance of 0.001.  


>[!NOTE]
> Users of OpenCascade, the 3D kernel used by Replicad, have noticed that fillets may often cause the program to fail. This may result in a broken geometry (which will be reported as errors in other 3D applications such as slicers for 3D printers), or in the crash of the program. The best approach reported is: 

> * if possible, try to add the fillets already in the sketching stage. The fillet mehtod for sketches is called `customCorner()` and is described in [Chapter 3](3.-Sketch). Alternatively you can use sketching commands such as `tangentArc` or `smoothSpline` to define arcs or smooth transitions instead of sharp corners;
> * when the rounding cannot be applied in the sketching stage, try to add the fillets to a completed shape as late as possible;
> * when a fillet fails, try to reduce the fillet size. OpenCascade cannot handle situations where a fillet completely removes an adjacent face. If you want to design such a geometry, try to find a different modelling approach to get the same result. 
> * inspect the shape closely after filleting to determine if there are faces missing. This is a clear indicator for socalled non-manifold geometry, i.e. geometry that does not fully enclose a volume. 


## 6.4 .chamfer()

A chamfer is defined as a symmetrical sloped angle applied to a sharp edge. Just like a rounding it takes away the sharp edge that is unpleasant to the touch and prone to damage. Chamfers are also often used to make it easier to assemble parts. When the chamfer is applied to a 90 degree angle it results in two 135 degree angles. When a part needs to be coated or painted, a bevel is a better finishing than a chamfer as there are still sharp angles, even though they are less sharp. 






## 6.5 .shell() 

The `.shell()` method creates a thin walled shape out of a solid, taking one or more faces away to provide an opening to the thin walled shape. The resulting shape is still a solid, as the walls are not infinitesimally thin as for a "shell" using the terminology as explained in [Chapter 2](2.-From-sketch-to-3D-part).
